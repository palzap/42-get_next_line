# Get Next Line

The "Get Next Line" project involves writing a function that reads from a file descriptor and returns the next line of text. The function should be able to handle different file descriptors and read from them in a way that ensures all the lines are read completely and without errors. It should also be able to handle different buffer sizes and deal with memory allocation and deallocation appropriately.
